# STATE: Spatial Cross-Species Toxicity Prediction (MultiDCP-CheMoE)

> Living memory across sessions. Read this first.

## Project Reference

- **Project:** Spatial Cross-Species Toxicity Prediction (MultiDCP-CheMoE)
- **Root:** `/raid/home/joshua/projects/GEX_vs_chemical_experiments/spatial_tests/` (subdir of umbrella repo `GEX_vs_chemical_experiments`; no own `.git`).
- **Core value:** Does a predicted, region-resolved molecular response signature predict organ-specific drug toxicity better than chemical structure alone, and does that signal translate across species (rodent → human)?
- **Current focus:** Phase 0 — Dataset acquisition & MANIFEST.
- **Isolation note:** This is a standalone GSD project. NEVER read/write `/raid/home/joshua/.planning` (separate, halted "liver" v0.5 project).

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 0 — Dataset acquisition & MANIFEST (P0) — **COMPLETE**
- **Plan:** 04 COMPLETE (final plan in P0)
- **Status:** Phase 0 done; proceed to Phase 1 (EDA — the bracket)
- **Progress:** `[##########          ] 1/8 phases complete (P0 all 4/4 plans done)`

**Next action:** Begin Phase 1 EDA (/gsd-plan-phase 1 or similar)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases total | 8 |
| Phases complete | 0 |
| Requirements total | 19 |
| Halt gates | 6 (phases 0,1,2,3,4,6) |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (locked / design)

- Frozen MultiDCP/CheMoE baseline; only the downstream tox head trains.
- Spatial is an additive comparison arm (S-B/S-C/S-F vs cell-line B/C), not a replacement.
- Visium whole-transcriptome only as basal input; targeted panels are annotation-only.
- Published region annotations default; per-organ only; fixed 3-layer concat-MLP; dose-response is a first-class third channel and confound control.
- One-to-one orthologs only; report dropped fraction.
- **Heart ACTIVATED 2026-06-21 (per user direction; deferral rescinded)** — now the 4th in-scope organ. Input: public Kuppe et al. 2022 Visium control sections (`kuppe_heart`, 4×.h5ad, Zenodo 6578047, CC BY 4.0; coverage 0.834 of MultiDCP 10716, `usable_as_input=True`). Labels: FDA DICTrank (`data/raw/labels/dictrank/`, 1318 drugs, no SMILES → needs structure join). EGA-gated Kanemaru remains non-usable. Heart still sequenced last.

### Proposed decisions (PENDING professor sign-off — confirm at phase planning)

1. **Spatial DE-rule divergence** `predicted_treated(drug, region_basal) - region_basal` (vs parent `treated - diseased`). Confirm at P2/P4.
2. **APAP single-drug Visium anchor** (GSE280652/GSE272564) as primary direct validity stand-in. Confirm at P2.
3. **Negative result is publishable** (stop-and-reframe vs stop-and-abandon). Confirm before P1/P4 gates are acted on.

(Operational sign-offs handled in P0: approve adding `squidpy`/Tangram to env; sign off dataset-accession corrections before download scripts.)

### Plan 01 decisions (locked)

- **slug field is single source of truth** for `data/raw/spatial/<slug>/` directory. Download driver and test suite must read `entry.slug`; no independent slugification.
- **test_raw_datasets_present** skips when RAW dir has no subdirectories (`.gitkeep` alone is not a trigger).
- **Stale accessions corrected** in `src/spatial/datasets.py`: Yu→figshare 22321447, Maynard→spatialLIBD, Lake/KPMP→GSE183456+GSE183279, Siletti→snRNA-seq.
- **Rodent basal-context candidates registered**: mouse liver (GSE272564 control arm), kidney (GSE252772), brain (GSE233983). Final healthy-spot confirmation at download (Pitfall 5).

### Plan 04 decisions (locked)

- **MultiDCP 10716-gene symbol list** sourced from `pdg_diseased_brddrugfiltered_avg_over_celltype_10x10717.csv` column names (verified len==10716, N_PDG confirmed).
- **Rodent coverage gate** = n_genes > 10000 (not human-symbol match); mouse/rat gene symbols differ; cross-species alignment is Phase 2 ortholog map.
- **Halt Gate 1: NOT FIRED** — human basal Visium >99% coverage; rodent datasets 32245 genes.
- **MANIFEST.md complete**: SHA256+license+Whole-transcriptome for all 13 datasets; both frozen-checkpoint SHAs; env snapshot with squidpy 1.8.2.
- **Phase 0 phase complete** — all DATA-01/02/03 requirements met; 132 tests pass.

### Plan 03 decisions (locked)

- **Ensembl release 116, query date 2026-06-20** — baked into raw TSV filename `orthologs_raw_116_20260620.tsv` (XC-10).
- **92.75% dropped fraction is expected** — BioMart returns all human genes including those with no homolog; strict mutual one2one yields ~15k of ~220k rows.
- **build_one2one_orthologs() accepts DataFrame, Path, or str** — offline testable against fixture without network.
- **Release probe regex** fixed to match `ensembl_mart_116` format (original matched `_gene_ensembl_NN`).

### Plan 02 decisions (locked)

- **P0 brain toxicity labels = SIDER meddra_all_se.tsv.gz (SOC filter at use-time)**; Lane-Ekins seizure and DNT-IVB DEFERRED to Phase 1.
- **DIRIL kidney supplement TODO note written** (Elsevier journal gate 404); kidney labels must be resolved before Phase 4. Never fabricated (XC-01).
- **DILIst/DILIrank acquired via sibling SHA-copy** (FDA bot protection blocked network; sibling has SHA-verified copies; data is real).
- **Figshare MD5 verification**: both Yu liver files (L5/L18) passed MD5 check.
- **13 spatial datasets downloaded**; KPMP GEO supplementary (4.87 GB) succeeded; KPMP portal ToS was not needed.
- **chen_brain_mtg expected_files corrected** in registry: was `GSE200474_RAW.tar` (404), now `GSE200474_Deseq2_...txt.gz` (actual GEO suppl file).

### Todos / watch items

- DIRIL kidney labels: resolve supplement URL before Phase 4 (see data/raw/labels/diril/DIRIL_TODO.txt).
- `src/spatial/region_signature.py` holds the `NotImplementedError` seam — must be replaced with the real frozen-checkpoint call in Phase 2, not before.
- Extend `src/spatial/` (132 passing tests now); do not rebuild. New files: tox_head.py [P2], splits.py [P3], train.py/eval.py [P4].
- 5 datasets with non-standard archive formats (no feature matrix accessible): abedini_kidney, canela_kidney, maynard_dlpfc, chen_brain_mtg, kanemaru_heart. Whole-transcriptome flag confirmed by registry; gene-count confirmation via extraction at Phase 1.
- gse252772_mouse_kidney: R .rds.gz files only — no Python-readable feature matrix without conversion. Needs `rpy2` or `anndata2ri` at Phase 1.

### Blockers

- None currently.

## Session Continuity
